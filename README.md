# Binary-Classification-of-Insurance-Cross-Selling
**Overview**:
This project aims to predict which customers are likely to respond positively to an automobile insurance offer. By leveraging various machine learning techniques, we developed and evaluated multiple models to determine the most effective approach for this binary classification problem.


**Dependencies**:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy


**Results**:
The Logistic Regression model performed the best, with an accuracy of 88%.
The Deep Learning Model using TensorFlow closely followed, with an accuracy of 87.7%.
Other models, such as the Decision Tree Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes, also performed reasonably well, with accuracies of 83% and 72%, respectively.


**Conclusion**:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting customer responses to automobile insurance offers. The Logistic Regression model outperformed others, making it a strong candidate for practical deployment in marketing campaigns. The deep learning model also showed promise, indicating the potential for further improvement with more data and fine-tuning.
